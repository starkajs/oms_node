166,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX has as standard the ability to be configured to hold multiple Data Streams and in this example we could have a Budget data stream as well as a Confirmed Consensus Forecast and Unconfirmed Forecast streams.
167,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX has as standard the ability to be configured to hold multiple Data Streams and in this example we would have the following; Original History – actual invoice sales: Sales History – actual order history (Demand): Levelled Demand – Order History that has been cleansed to remove abnormal demand (up/down) based on ABC Classification and a weighting to smooth Outliers. This smoothing can differ based on Product Group/Family Geography Channel etc.
168,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX analytics will allow for the analysis of  profitability by customer location or SKU level Consider Customer based pricing and cost of distributing product from different locations
169,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,Dynamic Dashboards are standard functionality in DSX and are configured to the requirements of the User i.e. Demand Planner Supply Planner Analyst Marketer etc.
170,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,Demonstrated in item 84: The comparison can be configured to compare any/multiple data streams and accompanying Alerts.
171,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,All scenario's can be simulated in a What-If and reviewed forecast numbers can be adjusted and compared before promoting to the Published Forecast.
172,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,Using DSX Workflow DSX can be configured to alert Commercial by e-mail/SMS that the forecast is available for review/change. Commercial would then review/change the consensus forecast and confirm in Workflow that the process is complete.
173,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,As in 93 a Step Change can be made and extended forward. More complex stepchanges can be made using Global Changes for example where the number of stores will increase/decrease we can enter a percentage uplift from a future period and extend into the future either on a single item or multiple items.
174,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX will generate a statistical forecast using up to 27 algorithms with a ‘Best Fit’ approach using medium and long term history as the basis for “forecasting” the recent past based on the 27 available formulas.  DSX will run up to 12 iterations for each of the 27 available forecast algorithms.  Since we know that the demand history is accurate the formula that did the best job of “forecasting” the known history is selected to generate the future forecast. The forecast will reflect Seasonality and Trends (up and down and as we have cleansed the History the forecast will reflect the seasonality and trends therefore picking up peak periods as well as low periods.    
175,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,As discussed DSX can hold multiple data streams. These data streams can be displayed in the same or separate spreadsheets and compared against each other Alerts can also be used to identify the variance between the different models to easily identify differences using varying percentages.  
176,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX can be configured to show for example a Waterfall Chart (and detail) to show forecast changes.
177,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX can be configured to Alert where for example the forecast is outside of a tolerance this can be multiple tolerances using percentages i.e. Red Yellow Green traffic lights to highlight items that need review.
178,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX can be configured to show Alerts where the Simulation Error or the actual forecast Accuracy is outside of tolerance for review and adjustment.

180,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,"All data streams in DSX can be manually adjusted and there is a full Notes facility to annotate adjustments made. Manual adjustments can be made as a fixed number or as a percentage change +/- on a single period or on the full year. Adjustments can also be made on a single period and the Filled Left/Right
For items where there is no historical data we can supersede or copy an existing (similar) item and use the history from that item or we can create the new item and apply a Launch or Seasonality Curve that we can create in DSX from a similar item or product family/group. This curve can also be adjusted and once the item begins to sell the curve will automatically update based on the rate of sale."
181,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,Note: All data streams can be displayed in all available (loaded) Units of Measure I.e. Cost Price Litres Weight Pallets etc.).
182,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,Standard view configured in DSX to show PEI (Projected Ending Inventory) verses DEI (Desired Ending Inventory) usually accompanied with an Alert to identify Negative PEI or where the inventory drops below Stocking Strategy.
183,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,"Standard functionality in DSX using Supersession and Global Change.
Supersession will combine the History from 2 or more SKU's which will supersede the multiple history streams.
Global Change can then be used to factor by period range to reflect expected growth."
184,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX has as standard full Aggregation functionality. Items/Customers can be aggregated to multiple levels based on any attributes loaded and in all available Units of Measure.

185,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,3,"We would almost certinaly mange this requirement in DSX Allocator which is a rules driven allocation tool which uses defined Hard Rules and Preference Rules.
We would need further information before we could demonstarte this functionality."
186,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,"DSX data spreadsheets can be displayed in multiple periodicities Days Weeks Months and Quarters with Totals and Averages in all Units of Measure.
Note: This example shows Week and Day numbers but can show dates if required."
187,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,As discussed DSX has the ability to hold multiple data streams therefore DSX can hold a Confirmed signed off forecast as a stream and then a stream(s) with Unconfirmed forecasts the Unconfirmed forecast can also include a Percentage Confidence figure and the system can then be configured to automatically load the Unconfirmed Forecast to the Adjusted Forecast when the Confidence percentage reached x% i.e. 85% this allows the Demand Planners to see what the confirmed (signed off) forecast is and see what the future Unconfirmed forecasts are.
188,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,DSX has promotional management functionality. Promotions can be entered into multiple Promotional data streams that represent the Promotion Type promotions can be generated as a percentage uplift of the Consensus Forecast or a fixed number increase for multiple periods Post Promotional effect can be added as well as cannibalisation/Halo effect. These promotions can then be added to the Consensus forecast to give a total requirement.
189,02075DB6-3CE8-4B7A-A48A-1A3FA3A5BBFD,4,"Using Curves DSX can take the 12 month Marketing plan and then extend based on the curve out for 2 years with multiple percentages to reflect growth.
This plan can be saved to an alternate data stream and once the item starts to sell the curve will automatically adjust the reflect the actual projection based on current sales and report any variances.
We would normally setup an NPI screen where we can view business impact based on actual verses projected."

164,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This is available as a standard report where a specific plan (Budget or Confirmed Forecast) can be selected to be displayed against actual orders in a particular time period (weekly vs monthly)
165,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This is available as a standard report where the rolling confirmed forecast is compared against actual sales. The report can be displayed in a particular time period (weekly vs monthly). The sales planning business process determines when the rolling plans is confirmed.
166,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"The demand forecasting process allows for the plans to be given the status of budget forecast as shown the screen shot. Once it has been marked to be the budget then it can be used in various other reports for comparison purposes.
"
167,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,History can be adjusted before the forecast is created as shown in the screen shot. The history can be adjusted by typing in the number or by adjusting the curve. Outliers can be spotted with suggestion for the corrected value. In addition we have features to correct per individual sales order line e.g. to handle return orders.
168,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,We have a detailed cost report that can be used to analyse this as shown in the screenshot
169,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The slice and dice report allows the user to dynamically create a report at the any level of detail. This can then be charted or graphed and saved to be used in presentations. This is in addition to the Microsoft PowerBI reports.
170,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The various sales plan analysis reports and metrics allows you to measure the gap.
171,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This can be accomplished by running the supply plan against a given demand plan scenario before publishing the final demand plan. In the screenshot it shows which demand plan was used to generate the supply plan
172,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The demand plan approval process involves a workflow and can be setup for commercial team to approve the plan before it can be published.
173,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This step change can be either in terms of % or volume and be entered in any unit of measure that is configured
174,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"The forecast configuration menu allows these settings to be done by specific data set.  Note that this is a configuration panel for the application (functional) administrator.
For explicit history correction use report Sales orders see the screenshot"
175,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,There is no limit to the number of different demand plans that could be created and compared against actuals
176,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,We have comparison reports that display the differences as shown in the screenshot
177,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"The safe zone can be expressed in terms of min or max deviation. Alternatively we can configure a so called ""news reporter"" to specification. Such a news reporter will bring deviations to the attention and can have a workflow to ensure the appropriate follow up."
178,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,There are standard reports which can be used do the analysis. In the screenshot it shows the various statistical ways of measuring the forecast deviations
179,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"The confirmed requirements can be identified by the check marks this prevents the statistical engine from reforecasting these confirmed values and only creating a statistical forecast for the non-confirmed values. 
"
180,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,When no historical data exists then the manual forecast can be managed by either entering the values for each time period (copied and pasted from EXCEL) or by giving a seasonality curve and then the annual value in any UOM.
181,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This is a configuration setting per strategy which defines the number of years of forecast to be created (Future 2 year(s)). Note that this is a configuration panel for the application (functional) administrator.
182,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,Exception reports exist where such conditions can be displayed. They could also be connected to workflows to drive a particular business process. 
183,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,As shown in the screen shot item supersession can be setup to allow for product cannibalisation for a given date range.
184,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,Sales forecasts can be adjusted at aggregated levels which will pro-rate to the individual products customers and capacity claims
185,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The impact of promotions on the overall profitability of the plan can be evaluated in a scenario
186,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"All demand forecasts can be displayed in either weekly/monthly/445/quarterly time periods. Forecasts calculated in months are also internally pro-rated to weeks and days based on the requirements  of the ""actor"" that takes  the forecast as input."
187,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This is possible in several ways. Clearest example is the supply to order setting which can also have a window applied. This can be used to plan to forecast for longer lead-time ingredients or managing the capacity claims but only schedule to order in the near term.
188,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,Promotions can exist per product across all customers buying the product or per product customer. Promotions will generate additional volume when in future and split the sales history in the regular portion and the promotional portion in once in the past. In the period that the promotion is happening actual promotional sales can be recorded and remaining promotional volumes are re-cast based on several heuristics.
189,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The first year 12 month can be manually entered or copied and pasted from EXCEL. Then the next year's 15% and 10% increases can be given as shown in the screenshot.
190,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,There are standard reports that allow for sales forecast analysis. Apart from the waterfall diagrams there are also other reports dedicated to comparing forecast against actuals at various level of detail.
191,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"Exception reports exist where such conditions can be displayed. In addition one can specify a news reporter that finds these situations as ""Excess stock"". News items can be connected to workflows(see the bottom part of the screenshot) to drive a particular business process."
192,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This screenshot has been created by setting the aggregation to product Group Item ABC Class Warehouse (Warehouse = Site). The report can also be configured to aggregate against other attributes of the products and warehouse dimensions.
193,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This is the same report as above used for another measure (demand) and with different columns for aggregating
194,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This can also be configured to display other attributes
195,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This can also be configured to display other attributes
196,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The plan can be shown by site resource and item as shown in the screenshot
197,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,Inventory target can be linked to demand variability forecast (in)accuracy and required service level
198,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,We have a workflow configurator that allows for necessary reports to be assigned to the different tasks within the S&OP business process. Whilst executing this workflow comments and assumptions can be logged which are the input to the reports for the S&OP meeting.
199,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The slice and dice report allows the user to dynamically create a report at the any level of detail. This can then be charted or graphed and saved to be used in presentations. This is in addition to the Microsoft PowerBI reports.
200,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The forecasted demand is converted into daily/weekly demand for operational purposes taking into consideration forecast consumption rules. A rough cut capacity plan is generated to show where the demand cannot be met
201,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"Our planning engines convert sales requirements into material needs and capacity claims applying the policy and parameters to drive the netting against opening inventory and keeping the projected stock to target levels. 
Material requirements are always up to date with the current plan whilst planners execute their respective workflows"
202,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,All our planning engines work towards an inventory target. The inventory target can be specified as a number of days of the demand as seen in the screenshot
203,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"This can be handled by creating a new demand plan scenario and keeping it independent of the regular ""published"" demand forecast. This way the SCO Plan can be checked against various demand scenarios to understand the impact. By marking the final version as ""Published"" one gets the final version sent for planning. The actuals can be compared against the various demand plans to see which demand scenario was closer to the truth as shown in the waterfall diagram."
204,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"We have a data layer called ""Data Shelter"". This layer allows you to manage data that does not exist in the ERP system and/or adjust values from ERP to better suit the planning purpose. This way the user can try out different capacities as a scenario capacity plan before deciding on the actual capacity. ERP provided value planner adjusted value and value to drive the plan are connected in a transparent and traceable manner.

We also have full scenario capability where the entire plan i.e. parameter values and resulting plan data is in a scenario replica."
205,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"We have a data layer called ""Data Shelter"". This layer allows you to manage data that does not exist in the ERP system and/or adjust values from a planning purpose. As shown in the screenshot the values can be changed over a period of time and a new scenario plan can be created to validate the impact of the change."
206,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The planning penalties (Prod.Priority column in yellow in screenshot) can be changed to see the impact on service level and cost
207,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The stock production and procurement plan can be generated for any given time horizon and time periods (weeks months 445 or quarters and telescoping)
208,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This can be accomplished by running the supply plan against a given demand plan scenario before publishing the final demand plan.

210,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,We provide extensive integration capabilities to export our plans to ERP including the tracking of the execution of the plan. The ERP system may apply other parameters (e.g. Bills of Materials) than the planning system suggested or even knows about. All these cases are handled. Implementing this requires close collaboration with operational people and the ERP experts to ensure that the correct functional behaviour is obtained.
211,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,Capacity claims are calculated per resource. If multiple plants are able to supply the product then requirements will be distributed based on rules or based on optimisation i.e. minimise cost.
212,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The work can be dragged and dropped between prime machines as shown in the Gantt chart
213,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,"This is displayed in the form of ""Unmet demand"" values. It is configurable if unmet demand should be considered lost or deferred until possible to meet again."
214,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,See example report. Converting the plan in the various claims on constrained capacities is standard capability.
215,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,The plan vs actual production is available in our standard report on adherence to plan
216,5E3F5889-7ABC-46AA-803B-74237690FD51,5,This can also be configured to display other attributes
